## 👨‍💻 About Me
I’m a passionate Flutter developer who enjoys building clean, responsive, and delightful mobile experiences. I focus on maintainable architecture, fluid UI/UX, and pragmatic testing. I like combining mobile development with backend tools (Firebase, Supabase) and occasionally explore embedded systems for hardware-integrated projects.

I value:
- Clean, testable, maintainable code
- Meaningful animations and polished UX
- Continuous learning and collaboration

---

## 🔭 What I build
- Cross-platform mobile apps with Flutter (Android & iOS)
- Offline-first apps with local persistence (Sqflite, Hive)
- Cloud-connected apps using Firebase & Supabase (Auth, Firestore/Realtime, Storage)
- Well-architected projects using Clean Architecture / BLoC / Provider / Riverpod
